Description
-----------

You're reading a blog and suddenly the screen goes dark and you lose what you
were reading because there's a "please subscribe" window in front of you.
You're browsing for song lyrics and suddenly you lose the lyrics to an
advertisement for a ringtone. Isn't it irritating?

This plugin is intended to remove those irritating modal lightbox popups that
interrupt you while you're trying to read a blog or a web site.

Currently blocks the following types of popup:

- Popup Domination
- Pippity Poppity
- Ringtone Maker
- AdSpot
- ShortTail
- jqueryModal
- aWeber
